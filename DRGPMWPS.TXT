DRGPMWPS.EXE is a sample program that demonstrates a mechanism for allowing
OS/2 Drag/Drop facilities (aka Direct Manipulation) to work between a normal
PM window and the WorkPlace Shell. Normally only WPS objects descended from the
WPFileSystem class (any objects that are 'Drives-folder descendents') are able
to convey enough information to normal PM programs to make Drag/Drop work
correctly. This sample program shows a way around that limitation. It is by no
means meant as the definitive way around this problem.

First, what are the reasons why the other WPS objects don't communicate well
with normal PM programs during Drag/Drop?

Let's take the simplest example: Using the DRM_OS2FILE Rendering mechanism,
Drag/Drop is brought down to the level of filenames. If an item is being dropped
on a PM window, that PM window can look at the DRAGITEM structure provided on
the drop and get the filename of the file being dropped. That's all it needs to
complete the drop in most cases. If you drag a file from a WPFileSystem folder
(let's say the config.sys icon from the C:\ folder opened from the Drives
folder), and drop it onto a PM window, that PM window will be able to get
C:\CONFIG.SYS as the file that's being dropped. That's what it would want.

Now let's say you are dragging a Program Object (a WPS object descended from the
WPProgram class). Let's say the Program Object represents the Lotus Freelance
program (FLG.EXE) which is located in the C:\LOTUS directory. You would expect
to be able to get the C:\LOTUS\FLG.EXE information when the program was dropped
on your PM window, right? Wrong. The directory path for a Program Object is
considered to be in the folder that contains it. The folder's location is in
relation to d:\Desktop where d: is your boot drive. So if your Program Object is
in the 'OS2Programs' folder and the Program title (the text under the icon) is
'Lotus Freelance', the only directory information that you could get
about the program would be 'd:\Desktop\OS2Programs\Lotus Freelance'. This
doesn't do much for a normal PM program which needs access to the
'C:\LOTUS\FLG.EXE' information.

So, how do you get that information? In the DRAGITEM structure associated with
an object being dragged is a field called ulItemID. That field is meant to
contain application-specific information. If a WPS object initiates the drag,
it places in ulItemID a pointer that is useful only to WPS objects. A normal PM
program cannot not do anything with that pointer because the memory that it
points to was allocated in the WPS process itself and it is not shared memory.
A WPS program can use ulItemID to get all kinds of information about the object
being dragged. If you've used containers, you know that a container record is
represented by a MINIRECORDCORE structure. The ulItemID field contains a
pointer to the MINIRECORDCORE structure of the Program Object within the folder
(the folder is a container). The MINIRECORDCORE address in the ulItemID field
is an address in memory that is right after some other information that is used
by the WPS. One piece of information stored here is a 'SOMAny' pointer that is
a pointer to a SOM object. To get that information from the ulItemID pointer, a
macro is used called OBJECT_FROM_PREC. So you would do this:

    SOMAny *somObject = OBJECT_FROM_PREC( pDragItem->ulItemID );

This macro subtracts a value from ulItemID (effectively stepping backwards
through memory) in order to obtain the SOMAny pointer. In other words, if the
SOMAny pointer is right before the MINIRECORDCORE structure in memory (which I
don't think it is), this is something like how the memory would look:

     ADDRESS  Value

     00000005 SOMAny pointer
     00000008 PMINIRECORDCORE structure pointer  (ulItemID)

The OBJECT_FROM_PREC macro would subtract 4 from ulItemID to get the SOMAny
pointer. This is assuming it is directly before the PMINIRECORDCORE. I traced it
at one time but I forget what the actual layout is.

<In actuality, it differs slightly from this but I think you get the point>

Anyway, once you get the SOMAny pointer, you have a pointer to the Program
Object and you can use this to do all sorts of things, including getting
information about the object.

The way you know that ulItemID contains such a pointer is that the Rendering
Mechanism used in the drag is DRM_OBJECT which is exclusively used by WPS
objects. Since ulItemID is really an application-defined field, you obviously
don't want to assume that every ulItemID that is dropped contains that value.

So at this point, if I haven't totally confused you, you should be seeing why
a regular PM program can't access the information. If it got the PDRAGITEM
pointer and did an OBJECT_FROM_PREC( pDragItem->ulItemID ) and tried to do
anything with the pointer returned, it would trap because that address is not
in its address space.

DRGPMWPS uses a mechanism to try and circumvent this. It creates a WPS 'agent'
object which is a full-fledged, albeit simple, WPS object. That object lives
in drgagent.dll. When DRGPMWPS.EXE comes up, it registers the DrgAgent class
(which loads drgagent.dll) and creates an object of that class. This object will
be an 'agent' for the normal PM window created by DRGPMWPS.EXE. Whenever the PM
window needs information about an object being dropped on it, it will ask
DrgAgent to help translate. All DRGPMWPS needs to pass DrgAgent is
pDragItem->ulItemID. When DrgAgent gets a UM_DRAGINFO_REQUEST message with this
ulItemID and the requesting window handle, it uses SOM/WPS methods to obtain
the information, copies the information to a suballocated shared memory chunk
and posts a UM_DRAGINFO message to the requesting window with that chunk.

Of course getting the communication going between the PM window and the WPS
object is not a simple task. This sample program uses a shared memory heap and
window messages. DrgAgent creates an object window whose window handle is made
available to the PM window via shared memory. When the PM window wants to pass
data to the WPS object or vice-versa, a chunk of memory is allocated from a
shared heap and its pointer is passed via a PM message to the other window.

Here is the conversation that happens when a WPS object is being dragged and
dropped on the PM window.

    PM Window                                 WPS object (DrgAgent)
    컴컴컴컴                                 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

 1) DM_DRAGOVER (allow the drop)
 2) DM_DROP (send the UM_DRAGINFO_REQUEST)
                                           3) UM_DRAGINFO_REQUEST
                                                get the info
                                                post the results to requestor
                                                   with the UM_DRAGINFO message
 4) UM_DRAGINFO (contains the data)



This sample program also attempts to show Drag/Drop working the other way (PM
Window initiates the drag and an icon is dropped on a WPS object). If the WPS
object is a WPProgram object, that WPProgram object's icon is changed to the
one that was dropped on it. Kinda cute. It uses other WPS methods to accomplish
this. Basically this is how it works:

When the PM window initiates a drag, it has DrgAgent format the DRAGITEM
structure so that it puts in ulItemID the MINIRECORDCORE pointer for the
DrgAgent object. When WPProgram objects get a DM_DRAGOVER message, they see
that the DRM_OBJECT Rendering Mechanism is being used and they use ulItemID to
get the somObject pointer for DrgAgent and call DrgAgent's wpDraggedOverObject
method. When the item is dropped on the object, it calls DrgAgent's
wpDroppedOnObject method. Therefore, DrgAgent then has enough information about
the dropped-on object (the dropped-on object's somObject pointer is passed to
the method) to get an HOBJECT pointer which it passes to the PM window which
does a WinSetObjectData to set the object's icon to the one that was dropped.

Whew!

There are problems if you try to drop onto a folder rather than a program. The
WPFolder object doesn't do the wpDraggedOverObject and wpDroppedOnObject stuff
so instead it copies the DrgAgent object into the folder. A better way to
implement this would have been to do a WinReplaceObjectClass of the WPFolder
class and override its wpDrop method, but alas this is just a sample program
and that would have caused you to have to 'install' the replacement class - a
little bit much for a sample program.

The DRGPMWPS sample is both DRGPMWPS.EXE and DRGAGENT.DLL. There are 6 .c
programs that comprise this sample:

DRGPMWPS.C - base code that creates the PM container window.
DRGAGENT.C - generated by the SOM emitter from DRGAGENT.CSC. Contains the
             code for the overridden WPS methods used by the DrgAgent object
             class.
DRAG.C     - contains all Drag/Drop related code.
COMMDATA.C - contains the code used to create and handle the shared memory that
             contains the common variables between the PM window and the
             DrgAgent object window.
HEAP.C     - contains the code used to implement the shared heap used by both
             the PM window and the DrgAgent object window.
COMMWIN.C  - contains the code used to implement DrgAgent's object window.

Note that this sample is a little lacking in comments. It would help to be a
little familiar with SOM/WPS. If not, it may help you get into it a little. I
basically ran out of time. This sammple was going to be very elaborate at one
time...

Hope this sample program helps someone.
